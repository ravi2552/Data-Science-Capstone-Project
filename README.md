# Data Science Capstone Project

## Description:

This repository holds the final capstone project for the Data Science with Python Career Program by Skill Academy. It utilizes a Car Details dataset to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), train and evaluate a model to predict car prices, and deploy a web application using Streamlit for user-driven predictions.


### Project Goals:

 - **Explore and Analyze:** Conduct in-depth exploration of the car dataset to understand its characteristics and identify potential relationships between features.
 - **Visualize:** Create insightful data visualizations to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies.
 - **Preprocess and Clean:** Address missing data, outliers, inconsistencies, and other data quality issues to prepare the data for modeling.
 - **Machine Learning Model Development:** Experiment with various machine learning techniques.
 - **Model Evaluation:** Employ metrics to assess model performance, compare different approaches, and select the best-performing model.
 - **Sample Prediction:** Demonstrate the functionality of the final model by generating predictions on sample data.
 - **Streamlit Deployment:** Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit for real-time car price predictions based on user-provided parameters.


### Features:

 - Comprehensive EDA notebook for detailed data exploration.
 - Well-structured code for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
 - Clear documentation and comments within the code.
 - Streamlit app for interactive price prediction.



### Getting Started:
- **Clone the Repository:** git clone https://github.com/ravi2552/Data-Science-Capstone-Project.git
- **Install Dependencies:** pip install -r requirements.txt
- **Run EDA and Modeling:** Open the EDA notebook in your Jupyter Notebook environment and follow the instructions within for analysis and model development.
- **Deploy Streamlit App:** streamlit run app.py
      - This will launch the Streamlit web app in your browser, allowing users to enter car details and receive price predictions.
